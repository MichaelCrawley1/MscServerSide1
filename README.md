# Web Performance testing environment for the web service applications 


Web Performance tests: To find out how web performance varies when informational data structures are consumed from a web service via different open sourced JavaScript Libraries. These applications were developed on a local client and a local web service using XAMPP to avoid network bottlenecks.

Key Development Technologies: JavaScript, JavaScript Libraries (jQuery, MooTools, Dojo, Extjs) JSON, XML and Plain text. 

Other Technologies:	AJAX, HTML5, CSS3, PHP and MySqli.

Developed by myself for my MSc project submission at UWS.

===== Notes =====

=================


-	This is the web service environment provided by the software Xampp.  For the client-side environment repository, please copy and paste the following url into your address bar: https://github.com/MichaelCrawley1/MscClientSide

-	To replicate these web performance tests please note this is for a windows environment only.  The software Xampp is a very heavy software, please expect one to two hours downloading time for each local environment.

-	After downloading it is recommended to store these two environments in two different usb ports

-	When the files are downloaded, place the xampp folder in the root of a directory.

-	The configured port for running Apache on this web service environment is localhost port 8080.

-	Files are simply accessed by typing "localhost:8080" into the URL of your browser.
